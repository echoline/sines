8b1t takes triplets of numbers on stdin arranged like so:

	440.00	0.75	1.0

* The first number here says to play a 440 hz tone.
* The second number says play it for .75 of "one second" (relative to 8000 hz signal by default)
* The third number says to play it at full volume.

A quarter-second rest looks like this:

	0	.25	0

8b1t converts them into character data corresponding to a Unsigned 8-bit audio at 8000 hertz by default
